Collection of games created while improve my programming skills.

Lets_Play.py
This is a small script that invites you to play a small number of games: coin flipper - dice roller - rock paper scissors.
There is also a hidden or "easter-egg" game.

Memory Game.zip
This is a memory game written in JavaScript following a tutorial.

New World Fishing.zip
This is an auto-fisher created for use in the MMORPG "New World". Written in python using the pyautogui API.
There is a mini game when leveling up your fishing skill. It is quite tedious so I created this to do the work while I went to eat, do gardening etc.

Packman.zip
Another JavaScript tutorial I was following to improve my programming.
